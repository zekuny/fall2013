Here is a code example taken from Ruby's website:

```
<h3>The Ideals of Ruby’s Creator</h3>

<p>Ruby is a language of careful balance. Its creator, <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Yukihiro “Matz”
Matsumoto</a>, blended parts of his favorite languages (Perl, Smalltalk,
Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp) to form a new language that balanced functional
programming with imperative programming.</p>

<p>He has often said that he is “trying to make Ruby natural, not simple,”
in a way that mirrors life.</p>
```
