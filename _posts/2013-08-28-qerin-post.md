Today I learned all about alternate realities. It seemed like a scary thought at first, but after hopping back and forth between them a couple of times, it actually wasn't too bad. I still can't say I understand everything about the different realities, but the more I go back and forth between them, the better I'll feel about it. I have added a title to the header and below I'm going to use syntax highlighting to show **Hello World!** in Javascript, mostly because I'm too scared to do much beyond that right now!



```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("Hello World!");
</script>
```
