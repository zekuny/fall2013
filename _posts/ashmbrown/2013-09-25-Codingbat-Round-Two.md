Greetings all,

I have not completed all of the exercises yet (I am slowly but surely getting there).  I'm struggling a bit and I need a break from staring at my computer, so I am posting what I have so far. I'll update this post once I have finished.

Without further ado, here is my second screenshot:

Also, just as a reminder, I messed up in the previous exercise and I did not complete tho exercises while I was signed into my account, so I lost the information when I did sign in.  Luckily, I took a screenshot prior to signing in and you can view it on my previous post. 

Thanks,
Ashley
