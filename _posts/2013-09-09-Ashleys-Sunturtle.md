###Ashley's Sun Turtle###

I found code to make a sun.  I changed the color, and just kept the turtle running. 
As you can see from the first screenshot, I made quite a few errors until I got it to work.  But hey, that's what it's all about, right?

Here is the code:

```python
import turtle

turtle.color('green', 'yellow')
turtle.begin_(fill)
while True:
 turtle.forward(200)
 turtle.left(170)
turtle.end_fill()
done()

```

I saved it in the nano window under sunturtle.py.  The code inspiration came from:
[Bucknell University](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~hyde/Python3/TurtleDirections.html). 

Here are some screen shots:
