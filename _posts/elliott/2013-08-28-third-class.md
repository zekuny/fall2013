Wednesday Aug 28th Readings:

1. Comoyo: [How we built our company blog](http://comoyo.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/how-comoyo-built-its-blog/) - Evidence that what we’re doing isn’t totally out of left field.  For bonus points, dig into some of the source code of their site.

2. Software Carpentry: [Computational Thinking](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/softeng/principles.html) - This is intended as a wrap-up essay but I often find it useful to ‘start at the end’.  Use the essay to orient yourself to concepts that we’ll be learning.

- [ ] In-Class Exercise: Write a simple post with syntax highlighting.

### Mini lecture: Github roundup
- A pull request is a wrapper around branch diffs
- #140
- "Fixes #134" is the magic phrase that closes issues
- Look for examples!
- We'll have more control over the flow from the command line
- Milestones = assignments
- One issue per assignment, please.  Multiple PRs OK, just keep track of them.
- post ideas
- Michelle's forking question.

### Left over from last time: How Jekyll works
- `_config.yml`: Where sitewide variables live
- `_posts/`: Where posts live
- `_layouts/`: HTML for Jekyll to instert our content into
- `*.markdown`: Pages for the site


- [x] In-Class Exercise: Open your first pull request

- [x] In-Class Exercise: Close your first pull request

- [x] In-Class: Pair up with your merging partner.

- [ ] In-Class: Set up VirtualBox Ubuntu. Extra credit for helping peers install outside of class. This is due by the end of the week.  Post to our Google community if you're having trouble setting it up and someone will help you out.
