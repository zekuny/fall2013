### Announcements

* Vocab open session
* Final project ideas: Examples & feedback
* Finding Meetups: Meetup.com.  Reactions?  When you go to a meetup, post about it.  Keep track of the link if you want.  At the end of the semester I'll ask you for a link to each of these posts
* Meetups for X group when you are in Y group
* Self Study: Has anyone been studying ahead?  Found any good resources? [Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com)
* Look ahead: Contribution Guidelines.  We'll come up with class contribution guidelines for our open source project together.
* Look ahead: Git on the command line.  Can't wait?  [Try git](http://try.github.io/)
* Showoff: [Jaleesa's Post](http://silshack.github.io/fall2013/post/2013/09/09/JaleesasTurtles.html) & [CSS pull request #257](https://github.com/silshack/fall2013/pull/257).  Jaleesa didn't like how huge her screenshots were on the site.  So she submitted a pull request changing the CSS of the site.  Now all images are centered and have a maximum width.  Nice work Jaleesa! 
* Milestones:  Make sure you have one issue or pull request under each Milestone.  If not, find the issue/pull request in question and @mention me to tag it to the right Milestone.  Thanks!

### Codingbat.com
This is a practice site.  You'll find others like them around the internet. We'll be focused on the Python section.  This week we'll complete a good many of these exercises and learn things along the way.  The more complicated ones we'll use pseudocode to map out the answers, then code them.

Do them in this order:

1. [Strings 1](http://codingbat.com/python/String-1)
2. [List 1](http://codingbat.com/python/List-1)
3. [Warmup 1](http://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-1)  The warmup problems are more complicated but have solutions with them.  Problems like [this one](http://codingbat.com/prob/p120546) are good at showing how multiple answers can solve the problem.

Stuck?  [String Docs](http://codingbat.com/doc/python-strings.html)
[List Docs](http://codingbat.com/doc/python-lists.html)

Fun fact: the [done page](http://codingbat.com/done) will show you stats on how long it took you to get various problems.  Don't worry about making mistakes- just make sure you're learning!

If you'd like to work ahead a little, continue on in this order:

4. [Logic 1](http://codingbat.com/python/Logic-1)
5. [Lists 2](http://codingbat.com/python/Logic-2)
6. [Warmup 2](http://codingbat.com/python/Warmup-2)

### Assignment
On Wednesday, add a screenshot of your progress on the site.  You'll likely want to create an account to save your progress from day to day.

Here's a screenshot of my progress prepping for the class:
