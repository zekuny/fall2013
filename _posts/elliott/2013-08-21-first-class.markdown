## FERPA

All students have the right to control who can see with grades (educational records) can know that they've been enrolled in a school (directory information).  Students participating in this course will be able to complete the public parts of the course under a pseudonymn if they choose.  This will not affect your grade.  Some benefits to participating as yourself include building a portfolio and being able to participate continuously with any community members you meet.

## Mini lecture: What is Code?

Discussion/Q&A: what do you think of when you think of code?  Come show me some code (on board or on my computer)?

Digital technology: binary encoding, hexidecimal

* Check out how [text is converted to Binary](http://www.roubaixinteractive.com/PlayGround/Binary_Conversion/Binary_To_Text.asp)
* Check out how [numbers are represented in different ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format)

Strategy for breaking down technology into grokable bits.
