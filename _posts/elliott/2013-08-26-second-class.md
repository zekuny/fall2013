## In-Class: Get set up on Google Plus
I think most of you are set up and have commented on the intro post.  Perfect.
* Quesiton I got RE social participation.  Concentric circles in wider and wider communities.

## In-Class: Get set up on Github
You all should have a Github user name.  
* Basic parts of Github: profile, organization, repo, issues, pull requests, milestones.
* Michelle's question in-line

## Mini-Lecture How the course blog is constructed.
* `_config.yml`: Where sitewide variables live
* `_posts/`: Where posts live
* `_layouts/`: HTML for Jekyll to instert our content into
* `*.markdown`: Pages for the site

## In-Class Exercise: Open your first issue
* Exercise as Milestone
* Example: Virginia had to drop the course
* Example: Jaleesa's typo on the attendance section
* Everyone open an issue "____'s first issue"
* Tag it to the first issue milestone
* look at the milestone

## In-Class Exercise: Close your first issue

## In-Class Exercise: Edit your Bio
* Fork the repo

## In-Class Exercise: Write an initial blog post

* Describe your changes in a commit
* add a YAML header (with your `_config` name as `author`)
* Write a post, using some features of Github Flavored Markdown
* Open a pull request from your new branch to the silshack master branch
* Pair up, review the code, and comment when it's ready to go.
