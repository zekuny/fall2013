# History of Programming Languages#
### Aka a history of many smart people ###

As I was doing the reading (at what point am I considered a "Pythonista?"), I started to think about the broader scope of programming languages. How many are there? Why are there so many of them? Are programmers just trying to show off by creating their own crazy language? Is python just a gateway language to all the other langauges out there and before I know it, I'll be immersed in Perl, C++, and whatever the hot new language on the interwebs? 

Anyway, I did some simple google investigating.  Here are some interesting things I found:

1) Wikipedia keeps a list of programming languages,[found here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

2) [Here is](http://james-iry.blogspot.com/2009/05/brief-incomplete-and-mostly-wrong.html)some programming languages history humor. Look to year 1991 for Python. 

3) Here's a cool infographic on the history of programming languages: ![History of Programming Languages](http://www.veracode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/History-Of-Programming-Languages-Veracode.jpg)
