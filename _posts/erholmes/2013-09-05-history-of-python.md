title: A Brief History of Python
---

When was Python invented?
* A-1976
* B-1989
* C-1998
* D-2003

The correct answer is B, 1989. [**Guido van Rossum**](http://www.python.org/~guido/) created Python in the Netherlands while working for Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI). Van Rossum had already helped to create [ABC](http://bit.ly/3Ib6na) earlier in his career. He saw some issues with ABC, but liked most of the features. So he decided to create a scripting language that used the syntax of ABC but fixed some of his complaints. With that idea and some free time in Decemmber of 1989, Van Rossum started writing Python. In 1991, the code was published to USENET and since then, there have been three major versions released.

For class, we will be using Phython 2.7 which was released in 2010. 
        
I would recommend everyone reading Van Rossum's bio and resume when you get a few minutes. He sounds like a fascinating guy with very awesome ideas. Also, he's considered a Benevolent Dictator for Life within the Python community and I don't think you get much cooler than that!
