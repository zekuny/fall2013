##Take photos in a video call

This is taken from the [Google help pages](https://support.google.com/plus/answer/3004555?hl=en).

Hangouts Capture lets you capture your favorite moments so you can save them or share them with others. The app lets you snap photos in your video call and the photos taken are shared with the other people invited to the video call via a post in the stream and a private photo collection.

You can use Hangouts Capture with some of the other apps, including Google Effects.
 *I assume you can also use this feature paired with the screen sharing feature as well.*

######Take photos

1. Select the Capture app on the left side of your video call screen. Your friends in the video call will see a notification that you’ve opened the app.
2. When you’re ready to take a picture, click the camera icon  at the bottom of the window. You’ll see a flash and hear a shutter sound when the photo is taken.
3. The icon will turn red while we process your photo, then green when you can take another photo.
