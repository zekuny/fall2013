# {{ site.course.number }} Initial Schedule: Subject to Change

## Office Hours

I will be available Wednesdays from 12-2pm and by appointment via our Google Plus community.

### Week 1: Digging into Source Code

Key Questions

* What is Text?

* What is a Computer?

* How Can Text Control Computers?

Wednesday Aug 21st Readings: 

1. None (first day of class)

In-Class: Get set up on Google Plus

In-Class: Get set up on Github

In-Class Exercise: Modify the class blog

## Week 2: Editing Text: Our class blog

Key Questions

* How do I use the command line?

* How do I make a fork on Github?

* How do I make a branch on git or Github?

* How do I open a pull request?

Monday Aug 26th Readings:

1. [Github Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html):  This is an article about the basic workflow we’ll be using to write our blog together.  You won’t understand everything in this article, which is fine because we’ll re-read it later in the class.  This is perhaps the most important content of the course, so pay attention.

2. [Github Flow in the Browser](https://github.com/blog/1557-github-flow-in-the-browser):  Recently Github has released features to allow the entire Github flow to happen in the browser (i.e. without using your command line on your computer).

3. Jekyllrb.com: Read over the site’s documentation and see how much of it you can understand.  Pay particular attention to the section on writing posts- this is what you’ll spend the most time doing.

* In-Class Exercise: Write an initial blog post

* In-Class Exercise: Open your first issue

* In-Class Exercise: Close your first issue

* Note: As we’ll learn, `git` is an open source command line version control system.  Github.com is the fastest growing `git` repository on the internet.  This distinction isn’t always immediately apparent.

Wednesday Aug 28th Readings:

1. Comoyo: [How we built our company blog](http://comoyo.github.io/blog/2012/06/11/how-comoyo-built-its-blog/) - Evidence that what we’re doing isn’t totally out of left field.  For bonus points, dig into some of the source code of their site.

2. Software Carpentry: [Computational Thinking](http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/softeng/principles.html) - This is intended as a wrap-up essay but I often find it useful to ‘start at the end’.  Use the essay to orient yourself to concepts that we’ll be learning.

* In-Class Exercise: Write a simple post with syntax highlighting

* In-Class Exercise: Open your first pull request

* In-Class Exercise: Close your first pull request

* In-Class: Pair up with your merging partner.
